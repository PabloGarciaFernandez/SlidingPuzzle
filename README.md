## Description

The project we are working on involves upgrading and enhancing a previous project that was developed during the grade. The primary objective is to improve the overall code quality and performance, aiming to showcase your advancements and proficiency in programming.

To achieve this, we will be revisiting the existing codebase and implementing various upgrades. These enhancements could include refactoring the code to improve its structure and readability, optimizing algorithms and data structures to enhance performance, and incorporating best coding practices and design patterns to make the code more maintainable and scalable.

We will also focus on modernizing the project by leveraging the latest technologies, libraries, and frameworks relevant to your domain.

Throughout the process, we will prioritize thorough testing and debugging to ensure the stability and reliability of the upgraded project. By rigorously testing the codebase, we aim to eliminate any existing bugs or issues and create a robust and error-free application.
